# blog-website
It's a blog website built with Angular12, Swiperjs, Bootstrap5,Sass,BEM methodology and Json server for the api
here is a <a href="https://cool-tanuki-468b58.netlify.app/#/" target="_blank">live demo</a>
## how it works
-first: go to the api folder and open the terminal in the root of the folder and run ```json-server api.json``` to run the local server

-second: go to the client-side folder and open the terminal on the root of the folder and run ```npm install``` to install all dependancies and then run ```ng serve -o```
to run the angular app.
and that's it now you can see and interact with the website!
